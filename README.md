This write-up will be discussing my journey through Day 1 of the Cozy Cloud Crew 30-Day Cloud Computing Challenge. For days 1-2 we were told to set up a free tier account on a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I chose to go with Azure and fortunately I am currently a student so I was able to sign up with my school email and receive a free $100 credit.

If you are also a student and would like to sign up with your school email, you can do so by visiting this link and clicking "Start free":

I had already redeemed my $100 Azure credit due to a class I took last semester where I had to set up a Linux Virtual Machine, so this days' tasks were already complete for me. #CozyCloudChallenge
